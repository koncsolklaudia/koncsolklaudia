1. **What is data?**
   Data refers to information, facts, or values that are collected, stored, and used for various purposes.

2. **What is a database?**
   A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that allows efficient retrieval, modification, and querying of that data.

3. **What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?**
   SQL is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to create, modify, and query databases and their data.

4. **What is a relational database?**
   A relational database is a type of database that stores and manages data in structured tables with predefined relationships between the tables.

5. **What is a table?**
   A table is a fundamental structure in a relational database that stores data in rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a specific attribute of the record.

6. **What is a column?**
   A column is a vertical element in a database table that represents a specific type of data, such as names, dates, or numbers.

7. **What kind of data types can we store in a column?**
   Common data types include integers, strings, dates, floating-point numbers, and more. The exact set of data types can vary between database systems.

8. **What kind of table relations exist?**
   Common table relationships include one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. These relationships define how records in one table are related to records in another table.

9. **What is a primary key? Why is it important?**
   A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It ensures data integrity, helps in fast retrieval, and enforces uniqueness.

10. **What is a foreign key? Why is it important?**
    A foreign key is a column that establishes a link between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. It enforces referential integrity and maintains relationships between tables.

11. **What does CRUD mean?**
    CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. These are the fundamental operations performed on data in a database.

12. **How can we create a database?**
    You typically create a database using SQL commands like `CREATE DATABASE`.

13. **How can we switch between databases?**
    You switch between databases using the `USE` statement in SQL.

14. **How can we create a table?**
    You create a table using the `CREATE TABLE` statement, specifying columns, their data types, and constraints.

15. **How can we check the existing tables?**
    You can retrieve a list of existing tables in a database using various SQL commands, depending on the database system you're using.

16. **How can we check the current table's properties?**
    The specifics can vary depending on the database system. In general, you can use commands like `DESCRIBE` or `SHOW COLUMNS` to retrieve table structure.

17. **How can we retrieve all data from a table?**
    You use the `SELECT` statement without specifying a `WHERE` condition to retrieve all data from a table.

18. **How can we retrieve all data but only specific columns from a table?**
    Use the `SELECT` statement and specify the columns you want to retrieve.

19. **How can we retrieve specific data from a table?**
    Use the `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause specifying the conditions for the data you want.

20. **What kind of operators do we have?**
    SQL provides various operators like equality (`=`), inequality (`!=` or `<>`), greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), logical AND (`AND`), logical OR (`OR`), etc.

21. **How can we add data to a table?**
    Use the `INSERT INTO` statement to add data to a table.

22. **How can we modify data in a table?**
    Use the `UPDATE` statement to modify existing data in a table.

23. **How can we remove data from a table?**
    Use the `DELETE FROM` statement with a `WHERE` clause to remove data from a table.

24. **How can you select only the different values?**
    You can use the `DISTINCT` keyword with the `SELECT` statement to retrieve only unique values.

25. **How can you manipulate the order of the result?**
    You can use the `ORDER BY` clause with the `SELECT` statement to sort the result in ascending or descending order based on specified columns.

26. **What are the common aggregate functions?**
    Common aggregate functions include `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`. They perform calculations on sets of values.

27. **How can we select from multiple tables?**
    You can use the `JOIN` clause to combine data from multiple tables based on specified conditions.
